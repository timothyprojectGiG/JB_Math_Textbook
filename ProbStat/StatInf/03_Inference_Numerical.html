<p>In the <a class="reference internal" href="02_Inference_Categorical.html"><span class="std std-doc">last section</span></a>, we learned about the statistical test of hypotheses, which tells us how we can choose between two statistical models.

<p>Using this data, we are going to explore the question of whether the Gentoo penguins at the Palmer Station differ significantly in body mass from the average Gentoo penguin body mass found in the scientific literature. (This example was inspired by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MSCI-599/unit_3_penguins">Erin Meyer-Gutbrod</a>.)</p>

<p>Though we could introduce a test based on the standard normal distribution—as we did in the <a class="reference internal" href="02_Inference_Categorical.html"><span class="std std-doc">previous section</span></a>—in the case of numerical data, we are going to utilize the <strong>T-test</strong> instead. As the name suggests, this test is based on the Student’s T-distribution. We do this because the T-test will apply both to the cases when the sample size is large and to the cases when it is relatively small.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.4.2. </span>The Student’s T-Distribution<a class="headerlink" href="#the-students-t-distribution" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When hypothesizing about a population proportion, the null hypothesis gives us a value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> that determines both the mean and standard deviation of the null distribution. On the other hand, the CLT for sample means tells us that as long as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is large enough,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\overline{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right).\]</div>
<p>Unfortunately, if we make a hypothesis about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>, we are still left with estimating <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>, the population standard deviation. If we have a good estimate for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>, perhaps from past experiments or expert knowledge, then this is no problem! If we don’t know <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>, our best estimate from the data will be to use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>, the sample standard deviation.</p>
<p>When we standardize the test statistic, we then have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-t-equation">
<span class="eqno">(6.13)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-t-equation" title="Link to this equation">#</a></span>\[ T = \frac{ \overline{X} - \mu } {S / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{\nu} \qquad \mbox{rather than} \qquad Z = \frac{ \overline{X} - \mu } {\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1).\]</div>
<p>The good news is that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> has a highly studied distribution called the Student’s T-distribution. The T-distribution looks a lot like the standard normal distribution, but it has a wider spread, i.e., more probability in the “tails” of the distribution. This wider spread reflects the extra uncertainty of using the sample standard deviation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> in place of the population standard deviation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>. The T-distribution has only one parameter, called “degrees of freedom”, which is represented by the Greek letter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> (<em>nu</em>, pronounced like “new”). This is calculated by subtracting one from the sample size, i.e., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu = n - 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have glossed over an important detail here: The statistic <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T = \frac{ \overline{X} - \mu } {S / \sqrt{n}}\)</span> has a T-distribution only if the data in the sample come from a normal distribution. Fortunately, if the sample size is large, we don’t need to worry too much about this assumption thanks to the CLT. But if the sample size is small, this becomes especially important!</p>
<p>Play around with the widget below to get an idea of what the T-distribution looks like compared to the standard normal distribution. Drag the slider to select different degrees of freedom, and click the labels in the legend to hide or show different parts of the graph. Notice how the T-distribution resembles the standard normal distribution more closely as the degrees of freedom increase.</p>

<p>When <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is large (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ge 30\)</span> or so), then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> should be close to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>, and the T-distribution more or less resembles the standard normal <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z\)</span>. So why use T at all? It turns out that the T-distribution can also be useful in cases when we do not have a large enough sample size to use the normal distribution! In this case, as we’ve already mentioned, we do need one extra assumption: that the population distribution has a normal distribution. This ensures that the sample average will also have a normal distribution. We’ll come back to this with a small sample example later in the section.</p>

<p>Now back to our current example: to use a T-test, we need to check the assumption that the underlying data come from a normal distribution. We have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=119\)</span> observations, which means we’re working with a large sample case. Additionally, the histogram of the body mass of the Gentoo penguins is roughly mound-shaped, so using the T-test is appropriate for this situation.</p>

<p>If the population mean really is 5500 g, then we would expect <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline X\)</span> to be close to 5500 most of the time. Hence, we would expect <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> to be close to 0 most of the time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the null hypothesis is not true, then we would expect <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline X\)</span> to be different than 5500, and hence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> will likely be much different from 0. Since we made a two-sided hypothesis, values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> that are much bigger than 0 <em>and</em> values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> much lower than 0 are both evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>We observed a very low value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> at -9.365. But again, we only get to observe one value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> and not the entire distribution! Is -9.365 different enough from 0 that we should start doubting that the null hypothesis is true? We can state this question as a probability: If the null hypothesis is really true, what is the chance that we would observe a value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> that is at least as far from 0 as the value we got (-9.365)?</p>

<p>This is the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>-value again! Remember how we use the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>-value to make a decision: If the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>-value is greater than our specified threshold <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>, then our data is compatible with the null hypothesis, and we <strong>fail to reject the null hypothesis</strong>. If the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>-value is less than our specified threshold <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>, then our test statistic is incompatible with the null hypothesis, and we will <strong>reject the null hypothesis</strong>.</p>
<p>In this case, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>-value is very small. As you can see from the image, the observed value is far from the hypothesized value, so the area under the curve in the “less likely” regions is miniscule. It’s so small, in fact, that the area measured by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>-value in the  figure above—the area between the density function and the line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = 0\)</span> that is to the left of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-T_{obs}\)</span> or to the right of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{obs}\)</span>—isn’t even visible at this scale.</p>

<p>As this graph shows, the area measured by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>-value is quite small (note the range of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>-axis).</p>
<p>Since the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>-value is so small, we choose to reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence that the Gentoo penguins in this area are smaller than the average Gentoo penguin.</p>
<p>Why the big difference? Probably the Encyclopedia of Life body mass trait is specifically for adult Gentoo penguins, and our observations contain younger penguins. If we wanted to make a stronger, publishable conclusion we could use this as a jumping off point for further research.</p>
<p>If we were writing this test for a publication we could use language like this: “We conducted a one-sample t-test to compare the body mass of Gentoo penguins measured at the Palmer Station with the theoretical mean adult Gentoo body mass of 5500 g pulled from the Encyclopedia of Life trait bank. The penguin body mass measurements in this study were significantly smaller than the theoretical mean (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p=6.05 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).”</p>

<p>These look appropriately normal-ish, and the large sample gives us extra wiggle room in the assumptions of the T-test. Moreover, the distributions don’t look too different, so we might start to expect that the true difference in means really is 0. So let’s perform the test!</p>
<p>The function we will use is a function from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">statsmodels</span></code> called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ttest_ind</span></code>. To use this function, we first need to create a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CompareMeans</span></code> object from our two samples. After we’ve done that, we will be able to call the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ttest_ind</span></code> function on this object to perform the actual T-test.</p>
<p>We set the argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">value</span></code> equal to the difference of means under our null hypothesis. We set the argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alternative</span></code> to “two-sided” to indicate that we have an two-sided alternative hypothesis. (Other possible values are “larger” and “smaller”.) Finally, we set the argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">usevar</span></code> to “unequal” to make sure that Welch’s method is used to calculate the degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>We do not find any evidence of a difference in average body mass between these two species, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>In this situation, we’ve failed to reject the null hypothesis, so we are not necessarily interested in computing a confidence interval for this difference (since we already suspect it to be 0). However, for future reference, here is how to compute a confidence interval associated with this test.</p>

<p>Note that this confidence interval contains 0. Since we have 95% confidence that the difference in the average mass of Adélie and Chinstrap penguins in the Palmer Station area is in this interval, this confirms our conclusion that we have no evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

<h3>Large Sample vs. Small Sample<a class="headerlink" href="#large-sample-vs-small-sample" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Why do we need the extra assumption of a normally distributed population in the case of a small sample? In non-technical terms, because we have less information in the data, we need more information from elsewhere (in this case, assumptions) to be able to make conclusions.</p>
<p>In the large sample case, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{X}\)</span> is normal. In the small sample case, if the sample comes from a normally distributed population, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{X}\)</span> will again be normal.</p>
<p>Below you can find plots of the sampling distribution of sample averages from both normal and non-normal distributions, each with a population mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 2. The top row looks at small samples (size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=10\)</span>), one from a non-normal distribution (left) and the other from a normal distribution (right). We take the average and “studentize” according to the formula for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-t-equation">(6.13)</a> above.</p>
<p>Look first at the upper left plot. The histogram of small-sample averages from the non-normal distribution do not fit well with a T-distribution on 9 degrees of freedom. However, the small-sample averages from the normal distribution in the upper right plot do!</p>
<p>In the bottom row you can find histograms of simulated large sample averages (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=50\)</span>), overlaid with the density function for a T-distribution on 49 degrees of freedom. The sample averages from both the non-normal (lower left) and normal (lower right) distributions end up fitting well with the T-distribution.</p>

<p>This shows us that, in order to use the T-test with a small sample, it’s necessary to assume that our data comes from a normal distribution. But how we can tell if this assumption is true? This is a nuanced question. Because you don’t have much data to start with, it’s difficult to draw strong conclusions about the distribution it came from! Some textbooks will simply tell you to look for rules of thumb: as long as there are no outliers, or the graph looks roughly “mound-shaped”, you’re ok to proceed with the test. There are even hypothesis tests to quantify this or more sophisticated visuals to use, but they are outside of the scope of this chapter.</p>

<h3>Robustness to Assumptions<a class="headerlink" href="#robustness-to-assumptions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Statisticians have determined that the T-test is fairly “robust” to the normality assumptions. In simple terms, robustness means that you can still trust the results of the test, even if your assumptions are only approximately met. In this case, if your data comes from something that is close to normal, the T-test will still work properly. If that feels too imprecise, that’s ok! It can take some time to develop your understanding and intuition for this.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.4.5. </span>Exercise 3.2<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-3-2" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study">Framingham Heart Study</a> is an ongoing study of cardiovascular health in the United States. The initial study followed over 5,000 volunteers from  Framingham, Massachusetts, USA over the course of several decades, and it still continues today. The study led to important findings in many areas, including a link between cholesterol and heart disease. (This exercise was inspired by an assignment from UC Berkeley’s <a class="reference external" href="http://data8.org/">Data 8</a>.)</p>
<p>We load in the data below from the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">framingham.csv</span></code> (click <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="../../_downloads/676633eefefb056c2f9726ae9198fbe9/framingham.csv"><span class="xref download myst">here</span></a> to download a copy). There are a number of different interesting variables to explore, but we will focus on exploring total cholesterol levels (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TOTCHOL</span></code>) versus the occurence of heart disease (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ANYCHD</span></code>). The variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ANYCHD</span></code> takes the value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> if the patient does not have heart disease and the value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> if they do.</p>
