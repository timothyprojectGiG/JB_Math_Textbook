    "## About This Chapter\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we introduce the basic tools of statistical inference: confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and linear regression. Our goal is to show how each of these can be more fully understood using the computational tools of Python and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen to write the following sections as an interactive demonstration of the tools of statistical inference for students. Rather than a simple guide to the statistical inference tools in Python, we provide code and plots which show how you can illustrate the theory in your classroom and use the tools to solve relevant problems. We have strived as much as possible to come up with examples that are interesting to students and relevant to an international audience, but you might choose to make some changes to the examples to suit your own context and audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistics Packages in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The main Python packages that provide statistics tools are `scipy` and `statsmodels`. Unfortunately, at the time of writing there is no single package that provides all the functionality we need, so we must use a mix of these. These are loaded into the Python environment through the following commands, which appear at the top of each of the interactive notebooks. These commands will only run if you have the packages installed in your environment. You can find instructions for how to do that in the introductory sections of this book."

    "Using `scipy`'s `stats` modules, one can access the features related to random variables and distributions, e.g., `scipy.stats.norm` for the normal distribution. From there you can randomly sample from the distribution, calculate probabilities with the `.cdf(...)` command, and even get the density function using `.pdf(...)`. Each of these are illustrated later in the text. We also use `scipy.stats` for calculating confidence intervals with the normal distribution, and one sample T-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `statsmodels` library provides a range of functionality for high level statistics, but here we only make use of a few of its functions. We use the `statsmodels` library for hypothesis tests about a population proportion, for two-sample T-tests, and for linear regression."

A number of these plots are interactive, generated using the `plotly` package. \n",
