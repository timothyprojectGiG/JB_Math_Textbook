    "Independent events are unrelated events. For example, a die roll coming up 1 is independent of whether the previous roll came up 1.\n",

    "Many common events are not independent. Consider and discuss the following events and whether the probability of each is high or low:\n",

    "The **conditional probability** of an event is based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event \\(based on the Wikipedia article on Bayes’ Theorem\\). We speak of the conditional probability that event Y occurs, given that event X occurred. We denote the probability as P\\(Y|X\\). \n",

    "Another thing to be cautious about is whether a parent's education is relevant to whether the teen goes to college promptly. For example, if instead of checking parent's education we checked whether the parent's favorite color is purple, we might see that 82.5% of teens who have a parent with the favorite color purple are in college and 17.5% of the teens who have a parent with the favorite color purple are not in college, and this would simply reflect that going to college is more common than not, rather than indicate that parental preference for purple is relevant.\n"
