    "Consider a six\\-sided die. \\(See image of two six\\-sided dice in the previous section.\\) The die can be used to select a number between 1 and 6 inclusive. By **inclusive**, we mean inclusive of the \"end points\" 1 and 6 \\(as well as of 2, 3, 4, and 5\\). The die can be used to select one of the numbers in an approximately random manner, modulo the slight imperfections \\(physical asymmetries\\) in the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you roll a perfect die $n$ times and keep a record of each outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "We list the following examples: What is the chance or **probability** that...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the die lands on a given number \\(say, 3\\) on the first roll?\n",
    "2. the die lands on a given number \\(say, 4\\) on the second roll?\n",
    "3. the die lands on a 1 or 6 on the first roll?\n",
    "4. the die lands on the same number on the first two rolls?\n",
    "5. the die lands on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then 6 when rolled six times ($n=6$)?\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\text{the number of outcomes that produce the event}}{\\text{the total number of possible outcomes}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this definition help you answer Example 1? Give it a try. Then read on!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do all of Examples 1\\-\\-5 **approximately** by using **computer simulation**. The computer **simulates** or imitates the rolling of a physical die. We can generate \\(pseudo\\-\\)random numbers many times and see what fraction of the cases result in the target outcome. Also, we can answer Problems 1\\-\\-5 **exactly** by using **mathematical ideas**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions and Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions and rules. The **sample space** is the set of possible outcomes. The sample space for the roll of the die is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. \n",
    "\n",
    "Definition. An **event** $E$ corresponds to a subset of the sample space. For example, one event $E$ is that the die lands on a 1 or a 6. The event $E$ corresponds to the subset {1, 6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1.  The probability that the die lands on a given number \\(say, 3\\) on the first roll is 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fact. The probability of an event $A$ is a real number $P(A)$ between 0 and 1 inclusive, for example 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fact. The probability of the sample space is 1. For example, the probability that the die lands on a 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 is 6/6 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fact. The probability that event $A$ does not occur is $P(\\text{not} A) = 1 - P(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3. The probability that the die lands on a 1 or a 6 is 2/6 or 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4. The sample space for two rolls of the die is {11, 12,..., 16, 21, 22,..., 26, 31, 32,..., 36,...61, 62,..., 66}, where each two\\-digit number represents two rolls of the die. An event $A$, in which the die lands on the same number on the first two rolls, corresponds to the set {11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66}. The probability that the die lands on the same number on the first two rolls is 6/36 or 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition. **Mutually exclusive** events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, one roll of the die can yield one of six mutually exclusive events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addition rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition rule for mutually exclusive events $A$ and $B$ is that $P(A \\ \\text{or} \\ B) = P(A) + P(B)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3. For example, the probability that the die lands on 1 \\(event $A$\\) or the die lands on 6 \\(event $B$\\) is $P(A \\ \\text{or} \\ B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3$. This agrees with the prior solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiplication rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication rule for mutually exclusive events $A$ and $B$ is that $P(A \\ \\text{and} \\ B) = P(A) P(B).$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4. For example, the probability that the die lands on the same number on the first two rolls is the probability that a number is rolled \\(event $A$\\) and the same number is rolled \\(event $B$\\) is $P(A \\ \\text{and} \\ B) = P(A) P(B) = 1 * 1/6 = 1/6$. This agrees with the prior solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section opened with Problems 1\\-\\-5 above. We said we could use a computer program to **simulate** the rolling of a physical die to answer the questions approximately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a `roll` function to generate \\(pseudo\\-\\)random numbers many times. We'll approximate the probability of an event by calculating the fraction of the total cases that result in the event.  We see a possible output below.\n"
