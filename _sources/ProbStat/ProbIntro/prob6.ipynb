    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Many games that people play for pleasure have mathematical aspects. Indeed </span><span style='font-size:medium'>**game theory**</span><span style='font-size:medium'> is a field of mathematics. </span>\n",

    "<span style='font-size:medium'>We can identify properties of games mathematically and via computer simulation. In this section, we focus on modeling, simulation, and visualization of the results of a few games that involve randomness. The goal is to get insights into the likelihoods of different outcomes, given rules, rather than actually to engage in games for pure entertainment. No prior familiarity with the games is assumed, and we do not include any betting, which some people consider morally objectionable.</span>\n",

    "<span style='font-size:medium'>The game of craps uses two six\\-sided dice. The rules for two versions of the game are as follows:</span>\n",

    "- <span style='font-size:medium'>In all other cases, the specific number rolled is “the point”, and you roll again until one of the following outcomes:</span>\n",
    "  - <span style='font-size:medium'>If you roll “the point” again, you win.</span>\n",
    "  - <span style='font-size:medium'>If you roll a 7, you lose.</span>\n",

    "2. <span style='font-size:medium'>“Don't Pass”:</span>\n",

    "- <span style='font-size:medium'>If the first roll is a 7 or 11, you lose.</span>\n",

    "## Choosing the Right One\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Consider the following problem:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>You arrive at a hotel and are invited to walk down the hall and choose what you consider the best out of $n$ rooms. The rooms are varied with no underlying organization. You will view them one\\-by\\-one, and the person in charge says you must accept or reject a room immediately after viewing it because a stream of others seeking lodging is coming in behind you. If you have not accepted a room before you reach the end of the hall, you will get the last of the $n$ rooms.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Problem: How can you maximize the chance that you will accept the room you consider the best?</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Optimal stopping problems like this one arise in various contexts, including financial markets \\(choosing when to sell stock in an </span>$n$<span style='font-size:medium'>\\-day period\\), housing markets \\(choosing when to sell a house in an </span>$n$<span style='font-size:medium'>\\-day period\\), and hiring or marriage \\(selecting someone when </span>$n$<span style='font-size:medium'> candidates \"dribble in\" sequentially\\).</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Notice that if your strategy is to pick a room at random, your chance of getting the best room is $1/n$. If your strategy is to choose the first, second, last, or \"middle\" room, your chance of getting the best room is also $1/n$. For larger values of $n$, this strategy performs increasingly poorly.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>An insight here is that you can benefit from a \"preview process.\" Set a strategy in which you preview $r$ rooms (rejecting each one) and record the maximum score $m$ from the preview set. Then pick the first room with a score that is better than $m$.\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>For example, suppose </span>$n = 10$<span style='font-size:medium'>. Previewing </span>$r$<span style='font-size:medium'> rooms is possible if </span>$0 \\le r < n$<span style='font-size:medium'>. Suppose your strategy is to preview </span>$r = 3$<span style='font-size:medium'> rooms. If the scores for the rooms are \\[67, 91, 85, 92, 2, 71, 32, 56, 37, 34\\], then </span>$m = 91$<span style='font-size:medium'>. The first room with a score better than </span>$m$<span style='font-size:medium'> is the fourth room with a score of 92. In this case, the strategy yielded the best room.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>It can be shown mathematically that the optimal fraction of the total rooms that you should preview is </span>$1/e$<span style='font-size:medium'> or approximately 37% as </span>$n$<span style='font-size:medium'> gets very large. The probability that you will select the best room this way is also </span>$1/e$<span style='font-size:medium'> for large </span>$n$<span style='font-size:medium'>. We can also come up with this advantageous fraction of rooms approximately via simulation.</span>\n",

    "## Coin\\-flipping Game\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Suppose you have a coin to flip and </span>$n$<span style='font-size:medium'> tokens. In this game, you put a fraction </span>$F$<span style='font-size:medium'> of your tokens \\(</span>$Fn$<span style='font-size:medium'> tokens\\)</span> <span style='font-size:medium'>on the table, </span>$0 <F \\le 1$<span style='font-size:medium'>. You choose either heads or tails for the game, for example heads. Then you flip the coin. If it comes up with your choice \\(heads\\), then you win </span>$Fn$<span style='font-size:medium'> additional tokens. If your choice is wrong \\(the coin comes up tails\\), then you lose all </span>$Fn$<span style='font-size:medium'> tokens. Repeat the process, each time using the same fraction </span>$F$<span style='font-size:medium'> of the number of tokens that you now have and using the same coin\\-flip choice \\(in this example, heads\\). Do this until you lose all your tokens or up to a maximum number of flips, for example 30, whichever comes first.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Example: You start the game with </span>$n=100$<span style='font-size:medium'> tokens. You decide that you will put down </span>$F = 1/2$<span style='font-size:medium'> of your tokens for each turn, use heads as your guess, and play until you lose all your tokens or up to a maximum of 30 flips, whichever comes first. As such, you put 50 tokens on the table. You flip the coin. It comes up heads, so you win 50 tokens. Therefore, you have 150 tokens altogether \\(150 points\\). So, next you put 75 tokens on the table. You flip the coin. It comes up tails, so you lose the 75 tokens. Now you have 75 tokens \\(75 points\\) altogether. In one version of the game, points must be positive integers, so you chose a convention for rounding up or rounding down when the number of tokens </span>$Fn$<span style='font-size:medium'>is odd. In another version, fractional points like 37.5 are allowed. We could simulate a continuation of the game with one of these conventions to determine how many points you have at the end of the game.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>It has been mathematically established that a winning strategy to maximize your points is to put down the optimal fraction </span>$F$<span style='font-size:medium'> of your tokens,  given by the Kelly criterion as \n",
