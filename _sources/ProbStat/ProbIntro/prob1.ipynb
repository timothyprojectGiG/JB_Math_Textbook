    "## Arbitrariness\n",
    "\n",
    "When you tell a friend to \"Pick a number between 1 and 10,\" you may think you are telling the friend to pick a **random** number. However, for true randomness, each outcome 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 must be equally likely. It turns out that people have a preference, usually unconscious, for picking some numbers over others. Therefore, you are really telling the friend to pick an **arbitrary** integer between 1 and 10, rather than a random one.\n",

    "## Pseudo\\-randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when computers do the choosing, most of time we should only say we have generated pseudo\\-random \\(fake random\\) numbers. A pseudo\\-random number generator, or PRNG, is a program that uses mathematical methods to **simulate** \\(mimic\\) randomness. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic process is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide the PRNG with an arbitrary seed \\(starting condition\\).\n",
    "2. Ask the PRNG for the next \"random\" number. It is produced by a step\\-by\\-step, complicated, but not random, process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a generator is also called a **deterministic** random bit generator. \"Deterministic\" means causally determined by preceding actions. The word \"deterministic\" is typically used in contrast to \"random.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, researchers use a cryptographically secure pseudo\\-random number generator \\(CSPRNG\\). A CSPRNG may sound like it uses true randomness \\(for strong security\\). However, you cannot safely assume that you have a completely fair \\(unbiased\\) \"coin flip\" or means of selection, even in this context. Fortunately, though, the prescriptive \\(deterministic\\) mechanism involved is hard to reverse, ensuring some measure of security. The key is to have a CSPRNG that is good enough for the application at hand.\n",

    "## Pseudo-random number generation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "People typically speak of computers **generating random numbers**. We will use this language when we use Python. However, Python \\(or Excel, Java, C, C\\+\\+, or R\\) is technically doing pseudo\\-random number generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a default mechanism is used to set the seed for the PRNG. If you want to use the default mechanism explicitly, you can import the`random`library and do\n",

Truly\\-random number generation is possible when we consider some physical phenomenon or process, such as atmospheric noise \\(static from lightning discharges\\), cosmic background radiation, etc. While truly random numbers are useful in many practical fields, it is sufficient for us to generate and use pseudo\\-random numbers in this book. \n",
