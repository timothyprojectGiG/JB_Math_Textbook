# COMPLEX VARIABLES IN GROUNDWATER MODELING - Wheaton College Team
:::{note}

This chapter applying complex variables to analyze contaminated groundwater flow was the work of a Wheaton College Team that included 
Dr. Paul Isihara (supervising professor), Lucy Henneker (student research assistant), and Andrew Luhmann (assisting professor),
with Nathaniel Bowden, Daws Bremner, Jonathan Higgins, Stephen McKay, and Julio Reyes (Math 352 students).

This material was published previously in the ILAP Module titled A Groundwater Contaminant
