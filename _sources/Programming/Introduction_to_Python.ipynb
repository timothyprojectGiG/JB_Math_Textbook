    "This chapter introduces programming concepts and how those concepts are expressed in the Python programming language. Keep in mind that *learning to program* and *learning the Python programming language* are different things. Learning to program involves learning to break problems down into computational steps and synthesizing those steps into an algorithm, independently of what programming language, if any, one is using. To learn a programming language is to learn how those computational steps are expressed in the syntax and idioms of a specific coding system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program and learning a programming language both take time and effort. A chapter like this isn't enough to teach you everything about Python if you already know how to program in another language, and it certainly isn't enough to teach you how to program if you haven't programmed before. Many good books and online tutorials exist for those purposes. What we hope to accomplish in this chapter is highlight basic facts about programming and the Python programming language so that you know what to anticipate in the chapters that follow. This way you can begin to follow and make changes to the code portions of the notebooks. Obsvering the code in this book can be your first step towards writing programs yourself."

Many common problems have already been solved, and their solutions have been collected for reuse. *Libraries*, organized collections of reusable code, act as extensions of the programming language itself, and an important part of mastering any programming language is learning the libraries that come standard with the language and the widely-used libraries that have been developed by the language's community of users. This section explains the fundamentals of libraries and related concepts like modules and packages by showing how to manage code with your own libraries and demonstrating parts of Python's standard library. Later sections highlight other libraries that are useful to know for other chapters in this book.\n",
