The number of terms---the *degree* of the polynomial---can be determined by the length of the list, and each coefficient's position in the list indicates the power of $x$ that the coefficient corresponds to.

Consider the following class for representing polynomials which wraps a list of coefficients together with the operation to evaluate that polynomial (we used the iterative Horner's rule version). We don't put that functionality into a method called `evaluate_poly` but instead into a special method called `__call__`. This name gets special recognition in Python, making the class *callable*. That means that instances of this class can be used as functions, which makes sense in this case because polynomials are mathematical functions."
