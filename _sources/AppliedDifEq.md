# DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY - Wheaton College Team
:::{note}
The purpose of this book is to show how differential equations can be used to solve real world issues in both human disease tracking and natural phenomena.
- Logistic Growth and COVID-19: This section shows how the logistic growth model can be useful in predicting the spread of a disease like COVID-19 (Section 1)
- The Basic SIR Model: Introduces the SIR model, a system of three differential equations used to track the populations of infected, recovered, and susceptible individuals in an epidemic (Section 2)
- Cholera in Haiti: Uses the SIR model to track the spread of Cholera in Haiti during an outbreak (Section 3)
- CWS Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Introduces the CWS model, a tool that can be useful in tracking the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (Section 4)
- Gravity Fed Water Delivery: Analyzes an application of Newton's 2nd law of motion (F=ma) on water fed delivery systems and introduces Bernoulli's equation (Section 5)
- Earthquake resistant Construction: Introduces the spring mass equation as it relates to structural dynamics, along with topics like resonance, damping, forcing,
