# PRE-COLLEGE - Wheaton College Team
:::{note}
The material in this chapter is a partial compilation of labs that were used in after-school programs at Cornerstone Academy and Celestial Ministries in Chicago, a math for the benefit of society general education course at Wheaton College (IL), and a research paper on the Chicago Hardship Index.  The idea for these labs originated in Summer 2020 by a Wheaton College (IL) team comprised of Dr. Paul Isihara (professor), Hope Wood (Emerald South Scholars staff) and Demetrius Crawford (Emerald South Scholars student) with subsequent support by  Dr. Peter Jantsch (assisting professor) along with Christian Cameron,  Sean Ferguson, Eric Fraatz, Lucy Henneker, Andy Holmberg, Natan Jara, Ethan Kile, Gracie Johnson, Alex McKeaney, Olivia Pearsall, Andy Peterson, Christopher Plimpton, Daniel Rendall, Kiki Rogers, Nathan Varberg, Willow Vander Kooi, and Kirsten Wikner (Wheaton students).
