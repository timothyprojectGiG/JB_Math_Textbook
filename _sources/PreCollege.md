The material in this chapter is a partial compilation of labs that were used in after-school programs at Cornerstone Academy and Celestial Ministries in Chicago, a math for the benefit of society general education course at Wheaton College (IL), and a research paper on the Chicago Hardship Index.  The idea for these labs coriginated in Summer 2020 by a Wheaton College (IL) team comprised of Dr. Paul Isihara (professor), Hope Wood (Emerald South Scholars staff) and Demetrius Crawford (Emerald South Scholars student) with subsequent support by  Dr. Peter Jantsch (assisting professor) along with Christian Cameron, Nathan Varberg, Demetrius Crawford, Sean Ferguson, Lucy Henneker, Andy Holmberg, Gracie Johnson, Olivia Pearsall, Andy Peterson, Christopher Plimpton, and Kiki Rogers (Wheaton students).
