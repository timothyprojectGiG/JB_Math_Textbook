    "In January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit Haiti, claiming over 200,000 lives. Less than two months later, a much larger 8.8 earthquake hit Chile, and fewer than 1000 lives were lost. Why Chile faired so much better than Haiti was not a result of the accuracy of earthquake predictions (seismology). Rather, lives were saves through the design and retrofitting of earthquake resistant buildings using methods from structural dynamics and civil engineering. \n",
    "\tIn this Module, we will introduce several aspects of earthquake resistant construction. We will begin in Section 2 by discussing how the spring mass equation (normally covered in a first undergraduate level ordinary differential equations course) is fundamental within structural dynamics. In Section 3, we generalize the basic equation using systems of ODE's to handle multiple-storied structures and other basic building design configurations. Finally, in Section 4, we recommend resources for those interested in further study.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "m\\stackrel{..}{u}+c\\stackrel{.}{u}+ku=F(t),\n",

    "\n",
    "where $m$, $c$ and $k$ are constants and the function $F(t)$ on the right hand side is sometimes called the **forcing term**. The dot indicates differentiation with respect to time $t$. A standard application of this equation is the so called **spring mass problem**, where $u(t)$ indicates the position of a mass $m$ attached to a spring with stiffness constant $k$. The constant $c$ is called the **damping constant** and the forcing term represents an external force acting on the mass such as a magnet.\n",
    "This equation is called the **fundamental equation of structural dynamics (FESD)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of analysis of structures undergoing stress created by ground motion due to earthquakes, $u(t)$ may represent the horizontal motion of the structure, $m$  the mass of the structure, and $k$ the stiffness of the structure (which depends on the material used in construction). The damping term represents the design features of the structure which regard its horizontal displacement. An external force on a lower level of the structure (eg. foundation) may result from horizontal acceleration of an upper level (eg. first floor) which is tied down into the lower level. A force on the upper level might be typically due to wind or perhaps in rare cases due to the impact of an object such as a car or tsunami.\n",
