    "Newton's 2nd Law of motion $F=ma=m\\frac{dv}{dt}$ is a classic differential equation with an amazingly wide range of physical applications.  In this section, we consider an application of Newton's 2nd law to analysis of gravity-fed water delivery systems. Understanding how the limit-quotient definition of derivative arises in a physical context is an important idea in understanding how differential equations governing physical processes are derived. In this case, solving the differential equation is simple. Antidifferentiation of the differential equation gives a solution which is called  Bernoulli's Law.  We will then show how Bernoulli's law applies to practical design of gravity-fed water delivery systems."

    "We begin in Section 1.1 by using elementary physics to derive a basic form of Bernoulli's equation, which describes conservation of energy for a fluid particle flowing along a streamline.  Next, in Section 1.2 we apply Bernoulli's equation to a simple gravity-fed water delivery system. We introduce the concept of hydraulic heads  to help visualize the conversion of potential energy into fluid pressure, revealing the need for break-pressure tanks to avoid any risk of pipe explosion. We also analyze the conversion of potential to kinetic energy to predict flow rates (important for meeting the client village's demand). Section 1.3 explains how the basic model is modified to account for friction and different kinds of water flow.  In particular, we show how the fluid velocity changes for laminar or viscous flow and explain qualitatively the use of Moody charts in finding the friction factor for turbulent flow.   Section 1.4  gives an example of steps involved in overall system design.    Section 1.5 looks at how basic water delivery systems have been effectively used in Honduras.  Finally, Section 1.6 gives suggestions for those interested in further study. Table 1 serves as a hand reference for the notation and units used in this Module.\n",

In the inviscid case all energy was conserved, but now some of the initial gravitational energy in the pipe will be lost to friction as it flows through the streamline.  This loss of energy is known as *head loss*, which is measured in meters and denoted as $h_f$.  Since all energy will either be conserved or lost to friction, Bernoulli's equation becomes\n",

This is the case of static pressure and is the same for inviscid and viscous flow.  However, when the outlet is open energy will be lost along the streamline.  Since the velocity and elevation heads will be unchanged by friction all head loss will come from the dynamic pressure head in the form of a pressure drop $\\Delta p$.  In other words,\n",

    "Laminar flow is the easiest to analyze, and allows us to find a mathematical expression for the effects of friction on the flow.  It can also be necessary for studying transitional flow since it is a combination of laminar and turbulent characteristics.  However, it is worth noting that laminar flow is very rare in gravity-fed water delivery systems due to the velocities and diameters used (**Exercise 4.2.4**).  For our derivation of velocity for a laminar flow we will begin by looking at a homogeneous, circular pipe with constant radius. To this end, we introduce cylindrical coordinates as follows (see Figure 16):\n",

That is, velocity is always parallel to the central axis of symmetry. It is important to note that velocity is no longer constant on a normal cross-section.  Friction occurs where the water contacts the pipe, creating a cross-sectional *velocity profile*, as shown in **Figure 17**. Note, in particular, that the velocity of the water is $\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{0}$ at the pipe wall (*no-slip condition*) and is a maximum along the central axis of symmetry of the pipe ($\\hat{r}=0$).\n",

A velocity profile is determined by its *velocity gradient*, meaning the rate of change $\\frac{du}{dr}$ of the magnitude of the velocity   $u=\\mid\\vec{u}\\mid$ with respect to $\\hat{r}$.     Friction is described by the *shear stress* $\\tau(r)$, which gives the magnitude of the frictional force per unit (lateral surface) area $r$ units from the central axis of symmetry.

    "\n",
    "Pipe A: Head loss is the smallest, suggesting that this pipe has the largest diameter $D$ and volumetric flow-rate $Q$. Pipe A can thus service a greater demand for water, and friction effects are only a small factor in impeding water flow from reaching the destination outlet. However, a larger size pipe has a lower pressure capacity $C$, so this pipe is most at risk of failure if the flow is halted by a closed outlet. In other words, a break-pressure tank is most likely needed for this pipe to prevent the static pressure from getting too high. (A break-pressure tank is required if the pipe's allowable pressure head is less than the initial elevation head ($h$) minus the head loss ($h_f$));\n",

    "Pipe B: This pipe has an intermediate pipe diameter and flow-rate, and as such, can meet an intermediate demand and also has an intermediate pressure capacity. A break-pressure tank  may or may not be needed. Even with significantly greater head loss than pipe A, there is still enough available energy to transport the water all the way to the outlet; and\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipe C: This pipe, with the smallest pipe diameter and volumetric flow-rate, would have the highest pressure capacity and thus is most likely to eliminate the need for a break-pressure tank.   However, it can only meet a limited demand. Furthermore, since the pipe has a smaller diameter, the water will move through it with a higher velocity and lose more energy to friction.  More energy goes into the head loss, making the HGL more steep and causing the HGL to fall below the pipe level.  Where the HGL falls below the pipe level, there is insufficient energy available to move the water in the pipe to the outlet. In this case, a pump would have to be employed. (For systems empowered by gravity alone, the HGL should never fall below the pipe level since this results in negative pressure (to satisfy Bernoulli's equation) which will prevent motion and can suck air or dirt into the pipe.  Ideally the pipe will be built at least 5 meters below the HGL.)\n",
