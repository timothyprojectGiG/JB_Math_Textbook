    "The purpose of this chapter is to show how differential equations can be used to solve real world issues in both human disease tracking and natural phenomena.\n",
    "- Logistic Growth and COVID-19: This section shows how the logistic growth model can be useful in predicting the spread of a disease like COVID-19\n",
    "- The Basic SIR Model: Introduces the SIR model, a system of three differential equations used to track the populations of infected, recovered, and susceptible individuals in an epidemic\n",
    "- Cholera in Haiti: Uses the SIR model to track the spread of Cholera in Haiti during an outbreak\n",
    "- CWS Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Introduces the CWS model, a tool that can be useful in tracking the progression of Alzheimer's Disease\n",
    "- Gravity Fed Water Delivery: Analyzes an application of Newton's 2nd law of motion (F=ma) on water fed delivery systems and introduces Bernoulli's equation\n",
    "- Earthquake resistant Construction: Introduces the spring mass equation as it relates to structural dynamics, along with topics like resonance, damping, and forcing"
