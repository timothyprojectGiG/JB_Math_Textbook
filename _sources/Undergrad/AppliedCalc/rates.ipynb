    "Along with max/min problems, related rates problems are one of the main applications introduced in calculus.  The idea of related rates is that if two or more variables are related to each  other (eg. radius $r$ and area $A$ of a circle), and one of the quantities is changing with time (for example, the radius $r(t)$ of a pond ripple may be expanding at a rate of $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 1 ft/sec$) than the other variable will also be changing with time (the area enclosed by the circular ripple is also changing with time.)  Knowing the formula relating the area $A$ to the radius $r$, namely\n",

Assume the sand flows smoothly and forms a conical pile in the bottom part, how fast is the height $h_{bottom}$ of the bottom conical pile increasing if the height of the sand in the top cone is 8 inches and the height of the sand in the bottom cone is 4 inches?"
