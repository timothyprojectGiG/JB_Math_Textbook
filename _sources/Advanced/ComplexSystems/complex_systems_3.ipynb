For example, magnetization occurs below a critical  temperature in the Ising model.  We are familiar with time reversible phase transitions such as water to ice and ice to water.

    "The Schelling model is an example of how the ideas of statistical physics might be applied within urban science. The Schelling model represents dynamics of residential moves within a city. The city is modelled as a checkerboard divided into cells.  Two types of agents  reside in the city, with at most one agent in each cell.  A utility function $u$ describes the degree of satisfaction of each agent with the neighborhood in which they reside and governs the dynamics of agent moves. Segregation consists of areas with higher densities of one type of agent.\n",
