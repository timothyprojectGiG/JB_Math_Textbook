    "A puzzle with only 1 or 2 types of pieces will be less complex than a jigsaw puzzle where each piece is unique.  For complex problems in human society, a major challenge is how to limit the characteristics of constituent parts so the entire population is subdivided into major types whose analysis gives a good picture of the state of the system as a whole. (Such a strategy is also used within statistical physics in the form of the re-normalization group approach [Bertin 2021].)\n",

For even higher values of $K$, the equilibrium $(F^*,C^*)$ is  a spiral sink. For still higher values of $K$, the spiral equilibrium $(F^*,C^*)$ loses its stability and a stable limit cycle (closed curve) solution appears. The  bifurcation diagram follows this pattern, showing a stable equilibrium   ($F_*=0, C_*>0$) for $K<k_1$. This equilibrium loses its stability at $K=k_1$ and there arises a new stable equilibrium $(F^*,C^*)$ with $F^*>0$ and $C^*>0$.
