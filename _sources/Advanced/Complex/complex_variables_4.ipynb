On the other hand, for higher $k$ values where the mid-stream well EWSL-2 extracts more downstream water (contributing to inefficiency), the overall system performance will improve if the strength ratio is reversed from 3:2 to 2:3.

    "The 2D groundwater flow modeling we have introduced in this Module is an elegant application of complex variables. Moreover, complex potentials are useful in many other physical contexts such as heat conduction,  and also gravitational and electrostatic fields. An important strength of using a complex potential $\\Omega(z)$ for groundwater modeling is that it gives a clearer picture of how contaminated flow can be captured  by extraction wells. Direction arrows which are perpendicular to equipotential lines  give the direction of streamlines but not a clear indication of dividing streamlines. Using a complex potential, one can precisely specify these streamlines via the stream function. This is useful to find critical parameter values such as for the well strength parameter.  As suggested, a system sensitivity analysis may quickly furnish evidence in answer to certain \"what if\" questions about the effectiveness or efficiency of the extraction well system after a modification of the original design. \n",
