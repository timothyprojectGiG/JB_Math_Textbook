    "Having introduced differentiable (also called analytic) functions in Section 2, we now turn to the topic of how these functions are used to model idealized 2-dimensional groundwater flow. We will also show how isolated singularities (points where a function is not differentiable) are used to describe sources or sinks. In modeling groundwater flow, we assume that the flow is two dimensional with $x$  corresponding to the east-west and $y$ to the north-south directions. In particular, such flow in 3 dimensions does not depend on $z$; that is, any plane parallel to the $(x,y)$-plane has an identical flow pattern. The groundwater flow equation used to model such flow in 3 dimensions results when the <i>continuity equation</i> is combined with Darcy's Law (Section 3.2) The continuity equation relates the rate of change in density at a given point $(x,y,z)$ to the divergence of the mass flow rate. This flow rate is the product of the density $\\rho(x,y,z;t)$ (mass per unit volume at the position $(x,y,z)$ and time $t$) times the fluid velocity $\\vec{v}(x,y,z;t)=\\mathbf{V}$  at the same point and time. The velocity is assumed to be continuously differentiable."

    "In general, the complex velocity $W$ is defined to be the negative of the derivative of $\\Omega$. That is, $W=-\\frac{d\\Omega}{dz}$.

    "which yields the stagnation points  $z=\\pm \\sqrt{d^{2}+\\frac{A}{q_{u}}\\frac{q_{s}}{\\pi h}d}$. A streamline which passes through a stagnation point is called a **dividing streamline**.  The value of the stream function $\\Psi$ at a stagnation point gives the value of the level curve representing the dividing streamline. If we think of the source as a pollution source, then the Rankine oval is the dividing streamline passing through the two stagnation points and thus indicates the boundary between uncontaminated and contaminated flow.\n",

In this case, the complex potential  takes the form $\\Omega(z)=-\\frac{q_u}{A}z-\\frac{\\sigma}{z}$ (see Exercise 3) and is used to represent uniform flow around a circular boundary.\n",
