    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce high-dimensional data by projecting the data onto a much-lower-dimensional subspace. The subspace is chosen so that the variance of the projected data points is maximized.\n",

    "For a simple example illustrating why maximizing the projected variance is useful, consider the scatterplot of COVID test rates and death rates by Chicago ZIP Code as shown in the figure below.  For the ZIP Codes in the shaded portion of the scatterplot, we notice  a much higher variance in the death rate than in the test rate. Hence, from the death rate for a ZIP Code, we would expect to learn more than from its test rate; the test rates are roughly the same for all ZIP Codes, but there is considerable spread in the death rates.  Thus, if we wish to reduce the dimensionality of the data, it would be more informative to project onto the death rate rather than  onto the test rate, since the former has greater variance. Dimension reduction is based on projections that maximize variance.\n",

    "b)  $\\,$ The basis vectors ${\\mathbf v_1}$, ${\\mathbf{v}_2}$ for the two-dimensional subspace determined by PCA correspond to the images in the figures below. The reduced dimensional representation of the letter 'a' in part ${\\bf a)}$ is the linear combination $2560.3{\\mathbf{v}_1}-2207.85\\mathbf{v_2}$. What would happen if we used two standard basis vectors $\\mathbf{e}_i$, $\\mathbf{e}_j$ to determine the subspace of projection? For example, what would happen if we choose $\\mathbf{e_1}=(1,0,0,\\dots,0)$ and $\\mathbf{e_2}=(0,1,0,0,\\dots,0)$?\n",
