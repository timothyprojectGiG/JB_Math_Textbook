    "In this section, we will consider the problem of clustering into $k$ groups a set of unlabelled points in a coordinate plane $\\mathbb{R}^2.$ For example, the figure below is a scatterplot of a data set from the Chicago Data Portal that shows the locations of 1,000 recent acts of violence in the city of Chicago. Police departments may use data like this to help identify clusters or \"hot spots\" in their violence reduction efforts. Another question is whether these crime locations might be naturally divided in some way, say, into two halves. \n",

This figure shows  $k=2$ clusters.  The I-55 Stevenson Expressway, which runs northeast from Stickney to downtown Chicago, is close to the boundary between the two clusters. High-density areas exist within each cluster, one in the West side and the other in much of the South side of the city. These areas reflect a long history of injustices in these parts of Chicago [Amdat 2021].\n",
