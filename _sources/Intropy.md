:::{note}
This chapter is designed to help us transition from the use of JNBs in pre-college outreach to the use of JNBs within college curriculum. Dr. VanDrunen, a computer scientist,  will give a guide to Python programming to help navigate the reader through the remainder of the book. Yiheng Liang, also a computer scientist, will cover the basics of working with data, including the use of the pandas and matplotlib libraries.
