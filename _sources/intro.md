# An Introduction to Python Jupyter Notebooks for College Math Teachers

Welcome to the online version of the 1st Edition of this Jupyter Book!

This is an open source project, and as such, we envision will undergo continual improvements.

We are making this book available in its current form in hope that it may prove to be beneficial to math teachers and students interested to use Jupyter Notebooks.
