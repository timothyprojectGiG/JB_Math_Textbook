    "This chapter introduces programming concepts and how those concepts are expressed in the Python programming language. Keep in mind that *learning to program* and *learning the Python programming language* are different things. Learning to program involves learning to break problems down into computational steps and synthesizing those steps into an algorithm, independently of what programming language, if any, one is using. To learn a programming language is to learn how those computational steps are expressed in the syntax and idioms of a specific coding system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program and learning a programming language both take time and effort. A chapter like this isn't enough to teach you everything about Python if you already know how to program in another language, and it certainly isn't enough to teach you how to program if you haven't programmed before. Many good books and online tutorials exist for those purposes. What we hope to accomplish in this chapter is highlight basic facts about programming and the Python programming language so that you know what to anticipate in the chapters that follow. This way you can begin to follow and make changes to the code portions of the notebooks. Obsvering the code in this book can be your first step towards writing programs yourself."
