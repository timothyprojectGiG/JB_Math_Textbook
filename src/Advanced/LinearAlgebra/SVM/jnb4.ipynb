    "In this section, we consider data points that are labeled as belonging to one of two classes. Our goal is to determine a line (more generally, a hyperplane) that correctly separates the data. That is, all the points in one class are on one side of the line (hyperplane), and all the points in the other class are on the other side. For example, the scatterplot in  the figure below is an example of linearly separable data, meaning that the data can be correctly separated by a line.  The scatterplot shows for each Chicago ZIP Code the median proportion of income spent on rent vs. \\% of single-parent households.  The labels indicate 1 = rent-burdened (median 12-month rent is  more than 30\\% of median annual income) or 0 = not rent-burdened. As such, the line $x=0.3$ separates the data. Points on one side of the line are in one class and points on the other in the other class.\n",

    "In this chapter, we have seen how linear algebra and optimization provide a framework for four types of machine-learning data analysis: ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, $k$-means clustering of unlabelled data, dimensionality analysis by principal component analysis, and binary classification of labeled data by support vector machines (SVM). Aggarwal [2020] provides an extensive in-depth treatment of this subject, and Williams [2018] is a good introduction to additional ways linear algebra is useful in data analysis.\n",

    "Data analysis is becoming increasingly automated with the development of machine learning tools, including Python JNBs [VanderPlas 2017]. In addition to being adept in the use of such computational tools, a key to proficiency as a data scientist is to have an inquisitive love for data as well as a good understanding of the mathematics underlying a given method of analysis. \n"

    "Our team also holds the view that data analysis can and should support efforts to solve pressing societal issues being tackled by organizations working in disadvantaged communities. The housing data which we used to introduce SVM, is an instructive example of applying data analysis tools to complex problems involving equitable distribution of scarce resources.  In pondering why SVM did not give the vertical line which correctly separates rent-burdened from non-rent-Chicago ZIP Codes, we realized that the $L_2$ SVM loss function penalizes data points that are correctly classified but are too close to the line (overfitting). In this case, if the default *regularization parameter* $C=1$ in Python's Support Vector Classifier SVC() were increased to $C=1000$, we would obtain the separating vertical hyperplane. ($C$ is inversely proportion to $\\lambda$ in the SVM loss function in **Section 5.7**).   Using the default SVM classifier with $C=1$ results in misclassifications: Accuracy = 0.7 (42 out of 60 total predictions were correct), Recall = 0.75 (36 of 48 rent-burdened ZIP Codes were correctly predicted), Precision = 0.86 (of the 42 ZIP Codes predicted to be rent-burdened, 36 were correctly predicted), and F-score = 0.8 (geometric mean of accuracy and precision). If the default model were the basis for a decision on whether to grant rent support, the false negatives (FN = 12) would deny support from qualified ZIP Codes, and  false positives (FP = 6) would result in an inequitable use of limited resources. Understanding the mathematics underlying the algorithm can help identify potential dangers in accepting the default ML output at face value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge  of the real-world context under consideration is paramount.  Although the vertical line $x=0.3$ correctly separates the data and thus has 100\\% accuracy, recall, and precision, there are  a dozen non-rent-burdened ZIP Codes close to the cutoff value of 0.3.  Gentrification can result in rapid rental increases that negatively impact low-income areas by creating additional rent-burdened households. Yet, since incomes may also increase in gentrifying areas, ZIP Codes close to but below the threshold line might not cross over into the rent-burdened category.  Similarly, ZIP Codes above the  threshold might move below in spite of the additional rent burden on low-income households. Those most in need of housing support might be overlooked if funding decisions are based on a superficial machine-learning analysis of aggregated data. A merely mathematical classification of such data might hide or contribute to inequity if not accompanied by a close working knowledge of the actual real-life context.\n"
