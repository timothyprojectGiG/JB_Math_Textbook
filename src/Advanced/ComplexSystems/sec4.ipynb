The state of each offender (incarcerated, parole, not incarcerated, not on parole) is important and must be tracked. The macroscopic state (percentage in each category) while in flux, may be expected to approach a steady state in the absence of policy changes.\n",

Table 1 gives the probability that an individual will transition from one state to another in 1980 and also in 2005. Determining the steady state populations associated with these transition probabilities is one way to assess improvement or deterioration of the criminal justice system over this 25 year period. \n",

    "To this end, in 1980, the probability that someone on Parole (third row) transitioned to Not Incarcerated, Not on Parole was roughly .40; the probability that someone on Parole transitioned to being Incarcerated was .13; and the probability that a person on Parole remained on Parole was .47.  Notice that the sum .40+.13+.47 =1 since the three states are the only possible states to which a parolee can transition.  Each of the rows in the transition matrices must add to 1 for the same reason.  \n",
