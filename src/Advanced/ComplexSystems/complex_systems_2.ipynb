    "We can also create a random walk using variable step sizes by random draws from a continuous probability distribution. <b> Figure 15</b> shows the difference between random walks which are normal vs. Cauchy (power-law)  distributed. The former gives rise to  two-dimensional Brownian motion where both the $x$ and $y$  step sizes are normally distributed.  Very large steps sizes have negligible probability of occurrence and are not observed.  On the other hand, large step sizes ('long-flights') are observed in power-law (heavy-tail) distributed random walks. These may correspond to catastrophic events (eg. a stock market crash). Complex systems are often  characterized by power-law behavior [Fieguth 2021].\n",
