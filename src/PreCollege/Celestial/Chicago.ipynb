    "In the Summer of 2020, Hope Wood (Wheaton College Urban Studies staff), Demetrius Crawford (Wheaton College Urban Studies outreach program participant) and I (Wheaton College math professor) launched the idea of creating JNB labs as a tool to teach math, data analysis and STEAM to disadvantaged Chicago grade-school students. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Fall 2020, Mr. Jim Wilkes, principal of Cornerstone Academy, an alternative Christian High School serving mainly low to middle income students on the West Side of Chicago held the pilot offering of a JNB after-school program via Zoom. A class of Wheaton College student mentors worked online in small groups of 2 or 3 with Cornerstone students. Mr. Wilkes and I served as co-program directors, and Hope Wood and Antoinette Ratliff as program staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following JNBs were developed for use with 8th graders participating in an after-school program at a non-profit organization called Celestial Ministries. The first two years, the scholars' middle school math teacher brought them to to the program and participated in the class. I served as teacher.  We are planning for the middle school teacher to take over the teaching responsibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Celestial Ministries serves single parent children in Lawndale neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. Parents and friends were invite to a recognition ceremony in which students demonstrated various functionalities of JNBs which covered in the program. Students who successfully completed the program were given a certificate and 1a 00 dollar stipend.\n",
